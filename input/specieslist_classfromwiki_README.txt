specieslist_classfromwiki.csv

Started by me (Lizzie) in late October 2015 while I was thinking of adding a level of taxonomy to models â€¦ so I pulled *very quickly* the class of each species from Wikipedia. 

Then TOL released their new trees and Beth suggested using these so I *quickly* went through synonyms.tsv and did what I could.

ALL THIS work should be checked, it was quick and dirty.
